## 📌 Project Overview

The Smart ELCB is a prototype safety device that monitors electrical circuits for earth leakage faults. When a fault is detected, it immediately trips the relay to cut power to the load — just like a real-world circuit breaker. What makes this prototype *smart* is the addition of a live web dashboard that displays real-time voltage and current readings, triggers a visual and audio alarm on fault detection, logs all events with timestamps, and allows remote system reset.

This project was built as a learning prototype combining embedded systems, real-time serial communication, WebSocket networking, and modern web frontend design.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time monitoring** — Live battery voltage and load current displayed on both the onboard LCD and the web dashboard
- **Earth leakage simulation** — A push button on Pin 2 simulates an earth leakage event
- **Instant trip action** — Relay cuts power immediately upon fault detection
- **Web dashboard** — Industrial-style dark UI with live charts, LCD replica, and event log
- **Drip alarm** — Visual flashing banner and audio alarm triggered on fault, with trip time and trip current recorded
- **Remote reset** — Reset button on the dashboard sends a serial command to the Arduino to restore normal operation
- **Event log** — Every fault, reset, and status change is timestamped and logged in the browser
- **GitHub integration** — Editable repository link box built into the dashboard

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Initialisation
On power-up, the Arduino holds the relay OFF for 2 seconds and averages 500 ADC samples from the ACS712 to calibrate the zero-current voltage (`Vzero`). This eliminates offset drift before the system goes live.

### 2. Normal Operation
Once calibrated, the relay energises (Active-Low: `LOW` = ON), powering the 12V LED load. The LCD displays live battery voltage and current draw. Every 500 ms, a JSON packet is sent over Serial to the Node.js server, which broadcasts it via WebSocket to the browser dashboard.

### 3. Fault Detection
When the push button on Pin 2 is pressed (simulating earth leakage), the Arduino:
- Records the trip current at the moment of fault
- Immediately drives the relay `HIGH` (OFF), cutting load power
- Displays `EARTH LEAKAGE!` and the trip current on the LCD
- Sends a fault JSON event over Serial

### 4. Dashboard Response
The web dashboard receives the fault event and:
- Flashes the alarm banner red
- Sounds an alternating audio alarm
- Logs the fault time and trip current
- Marks the fault point on the live charts
- Enables the Reset button

### 5. Reset Flow
Clicking **Reset** on the dashboard sends a `POST /api/reset` request to the Node.js server, which writes the character `'R'` over Serial to the Arduino. The Arduino then re-calibrates and re-energises the relay, and the dashboard returns to normal state.

```
Browser → POST /api/reset → Node.js → Serial 'R' → Arduino → Relay ON → JSON reset event → WebSocket → Browser
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- [Node.js v18 LTS or newer](https://nodejs.org)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (recommended)
- Library: **LiquidCrystal I2C** by Frank de Brabander (install via Arduino IDE Library Manager)

### Step 1 — Upload the Arduino Sketch
1. Open `arduino/smart_elcb.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Install the `LiquidCrystal I2C` library if not already installed
3. Select **Board: Arduino Uno** and your correct COM port
4. Click **Upload**
5. Open Serial Monitor (baud: 9600) to verify JSON output, then **close it**

### Step 2 — Configure the Serial Port
Open `server/server.js` and edit line 17:
```js
const SERIAL_PORT = process.env.SERIAL_PORT || 'COM3'; // ← change to your port
```

| OS | Example |
|---|---|
| Windows | `'COM3'` |
| macOS | `'/dev/cu.usbmodem14101'` |
| Linux | `'/dev/ttyACM0'` |

### Step 3 — Start the Server
```bash
cd server
npm install
node server.js
```

### Step 4 — Open the Dashboard
Navigate to **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

         Serial: fault event
         Dashboard: alarm + log
              │
              └──── Serial 'R' received?
                         │ YES

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Replace push button with a real CT-based differential current sensing circuit for genuine earth leakage detection
- Add Wi-Fi capability using ESP8266/ESP32 to eliminate the need for a USB serial connection
- Store fault history in EEPROM so it survives power cycles
- Add SMS/email alert integration for remote notification
- Implement MQTT protocol for IoT dashboard integration
- Add a current threshold setting on the dashboard to configure the trip sensitivity
